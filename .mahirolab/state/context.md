- ✅ State management directory structure ready

## Completed
- ✅ Understood user's goal: Create foreign stock blog
- ✅ Analyzed current repository state
- ✅ Identified previous blog implementation (being removed)
- ✅ Created session context (this file)

## Decisions Made
- **Decision 1:** Start fresh session with context creation (ccc)
  - Rationale: User explicitly requested "ccc" then "nnn" workflow
- **Decision 2:** Document the transition state (previous blog → new foreign stock blog)
  - Rationale: Important to understand what existed before planning new structure

## Current Status
**Context created and documented.**

Previous blog appears to be a general-purpose blog with:
- Article management
- Search and filter functionality
- Responsive layout with sidebar
- Mock data structure

Ready to proceed to planning phase (nnn) for new foreign stock blog.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Run `nnn` - Create detailed implementation plan for foreign stock blog
- [ ] Define specific features for foreign stock content:
  - Stock information display (price, charts, fundamentals)
  - Market data integration requirements
  - Country/exchange categorization
  - News and analysis sections
  - Portfolio tracking (if needed)
- [ ] Determine technology stack adjustments (charting libraries, data sources, etc.)
- [ ] Plan data structure for foreign stocks
- [ ] Design UI/UX specific to stock information presentation

## Blockers/Issues
- **Clarification needed:**
  - What specific foreign markets? (US, EU, Asia, etc.)
  - What type of content? (Educational, news, analysis, portfolio tracking?)
  - Data source requirements? (Real-time, delayed, fundamental only?)
  - Target audience? (Beginners, advanced traders, investors?)

## Questions for User (to inform planning)
These will help create a more targeted implementation plan in the nnn phase:
1. Which foreign stock markets are primary focus? (e.g., US S&P500, NASDAQ, European markets, Asian markets)
2. What type of content will the blog feature? (Articles, stock analysis, news aggregation, educational content, portfolio tools?)
3. Do you need real-time or delayed market data? Or just static educational content?
4. Any specific features required? (Stock screener, watchlist, comparison tools, etc.)
