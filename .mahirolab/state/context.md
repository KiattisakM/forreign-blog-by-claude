# Session Context

**Date:** 2025-10-22 16:17
**Session ID:** 20251022_161744
**Version:** v1

## Goals
- Review and organize the Codex architecture setup
- Address git changes (deletions and new untracked files)
- Initialize state management system for future sessions
- Ensure project is production-ready

## Project Overview
This is a **Foreign Stock Blog** - a modern React application for international stock market analysis and insights.

**Tech Stack:**
- React 19.0 with TypeScript 5.6
- Vite 6.0 for build tooling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- React Router for navigation

**Key Features:**
- Multi-market support (US, European, Asian markets)
- Sector analysis and filtering
- Dark mode with persistent preferences
- URL state management for shareable links
- Performance optimized with code splitting
- SEO optimized with meta tags

## Completed
- ✅ Codex architecture fully documented
- ✅ Shortcode protocol defined (ccc, nnn, gogogo, rrr, lll, rrresearch, www)
- ✅ State management directory structure created
- ✅ Context v1 initialized (first session)
- ✅ Recent development activity (9 commits in 7 days)
- ✅ Production-ready features implemented

## Decisions Made
- **State Management:** Adopted `.mahirolab/state/` structure with context versioning
- **Shortcode Protocol:** Implemented for efficient Claude-User communication
- **Codex Architecture:** Using orchestrator/worker pattern with background jobs
- **File Organization:** Separating plans, retrospectives, and context history

## Current Status
Fresh session started. Project has:
- 48 source files (TypeScript/React)
- 21 documentation files in `.mahirolab/`
- 160KB total in `.mahirolab/` directory
- Clean architecture with helper scripts ready

**Git Status:**
- Branch: main
- 20 files with changes (modified/deleted)
- Notable changes:
  - Modified: codex-research.sh, codex-worker-launcher.sh
  - Modified: PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md, SHORTCODES.md
  - Deleted: Several old state files and UI component aliases
- Untracked: `.claude/`, `.mahirolab/examples/`, `.mahirolab/templates/`, `STATE_MANAGEMENT.md`

## Next Steps
- [ ] Review git changes and decide what to commit
- [ ] Stage new untracked files (`.claude/`, examples, templates)
- [ ] Clean up deleted file references
- [ ] Create implementation plan if needed (run `nnn`)
- [ ] Consider cleanup of old state files

## Blockers/Issues
- Several files staged for deletion - need review before commit
- New untracked files need to be staged
- No active plan currently (can create with `nnn` if needed)
