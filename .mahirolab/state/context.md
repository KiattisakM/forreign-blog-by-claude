## Technology Stack

| Category | Technology | Version | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|---------|
| Framework | React | 19.0 | UI framework |
| Language | TypeScript | 5.6 | Type safety |
| Build Tool | Vite | 6.0 | Fast dev server & bundler |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | 3.4 | Utility-first CSS |
| Components | shadcn/ui | Latest | Accessible UI primitives |
| Routing | React Router | 6.28 | Client-side routing (to be implemented) |

## Next Steps (Phase 4: Advanced Features - Optional)

### Potential Enhancements

1. **Dark Mode Toggle**
   - Toggle button in header
   - Persist preference in localStorage
   - Smooth transitions

2. **URL State Management**
   - Store filters in URL query parameters
   - Shareable filtered views
   - Back/forward browser navigation

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - React.lazy for code splitting
   - Image optimization
   - Bundle analysis

4. **Enhanced UX**
   - Loading skeletons
   - Scroll to top button
   - Breadcrumb navigation
   - Toast notifications

## Key Design Patterns

### Color Coding
- **Markets:** US=Blue, EU=Purple, ASIA=Orange, UK=Red, Canada=Green, Australia=Yellow
- **Sectors:** Each sector has distinct color (Indigo, Emerald, Rose, Amber, etc.)
- **Categories:** Analysis=Blue, News=Red, Education=Green, Opinion=Purple, Earnings=Yellow
- **Sentiment:** Bullish=Green, Bearish=Red, Neutral=Gray

### Component Patterns
- All cards use shadcn/ui Card component
- Badges for quick visual identification
- Responsive design: mobile-first with Tailwind breakpoints
- Dark mode support via Tailwind dark: prefix

### Data Patterns
- Mock data in TypeScript arrays (no backend yet)
- Client-side filtering and search
- Type-safe props and state

## Build & Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Dev server (port 5173)
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm run build

# Type check
pnpm run build  # includes tsc -b

# Preview production build
pnpm preview
```

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
- No backend/API integration
- No real-time stock data
- No user authentication
- No persistent storage
- No actual charts (just articles about stocks)

### Phase 6 Future Features
- Real-time stock price integration (Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance API)
- Interactive charts (candlestick, line charts using recharts/lightweight-charts)
- User accounts and saved articles
- Watchlist feature
- Comments system
- Admin dashboard for content management
- Email newsletter
- Social sharing
- Analytics integration

## Success Metrics

- [✅] All 6 routes functional and navigable
- [✅] Filters work correctly (market, sector, search)
- [✅] Responsive on mobile, tablet, desktop
- [✅] Fast page loads (<2s)
- [✅] No TypeScript errors
- [✅] Professional appearance
- [✅] Accessible (keyboard navigation, screen reader friendly)

## Risks & Considerations

1. **Scope Creep:** Stick to MVP, save advanced features for Phase 6
2. **Performance:** With 20 articles, no issues. Monitor if adding more.
3. **Design Consistency:** shadcn/ui ensures consistent look
4. **Mobile UX:** Sheet component for mobile menu already implemented

## Team Context

- **User:** Product owner/developer
- **Claude:** AI assistant implementing the plan
- **Communication Protocol:** Using shortcodes (ccc, nnn, gogogo, rrr, lll)

## Git Strategy

- Commit at end of each phase
- Descriptive commit messages with conventional commits format
- All commits include Claude Code attribution
- Clean history with logical checkpoints
