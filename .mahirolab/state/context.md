## Goals
- Review and organize the Codex architecture setup
- Address git changes (deletions and new untracked files)
- Initialize state management system for future sessions
- Ensure project is production-ready
- Build backend API for Foreign Stock Blog (PostgreSQL + Express + Prisma)

## Project Overview
This is a **Foreign Stock Blog** - a modern React application for international stock market analysis and insights.

**Tech Stack:**
- React 19.0 with TypeScript 5.6
- Vite 6.0 for build tooling

- React Router for navigation

**Key Features:**
- Multi-market support (US, European, Asian markets)
- Sector analysis and filtering
- Dark mode with persistent preferences
- URL state management for shareable links
- Performance optimized with code splitting
- SEO optimized with meta tags

## Completed
- ✅ Codex architecture fully documented
- ✅ Shortcode protocol defined (ccc, nnn, gogogo, rrr, lll, rrresearch, www)
- ✅ State management directory structure created
- ✅ Context v1 initialized (first session)
- ✅ Recent development activity (9 commits in 7 days)
- ✅ Production-ready features implemented
- ✅ Backend API implementation (Express + TypeScript + Prisma)
- ✅ Database schema and migrations created
- ✅ Web scraper architecture built
- ✅ API endpoints tested and working
- ✅ Backend code committed (37 files, 6,043 lines)
- ✅ Session retrospective created (retrospective_20251027.md)

## Decisions Made
- **State Management:** Adopted `.mahirolab/state/` structure with context versioning
- **Shortcode Protocol:** Implemented for efficient Claude-User communication
- **Codex Architecture:** Using orchestrator/worker pattern with background jobs
- **File Organization:** Separating plans, retrospectives, and context history
- **Backend Stack:** PostgreSQL + Express.js + Prisma (TypeScript)
- **Authentication:** Implement JWT-based authentication system (Phase 2 - postponed)
- **Project Structure:** Monorepo (server/ directory)
- **Deployment:** Vercel for both frontend and backend
- **Real-time Updates:** Implement WebSocket/SSE for live stock data updates
- **Scraper Schedule:** Run every 1 hour for fresh content

## Current Status
Fresh session started. Project has:
- 48 source files (TypeScript/React)
- 21 documentation files in `.mahirolab/`
- 160KB total in `.mahirolab/` directory
- Clean architecture with helper scripts ready

**Git Status:**
- Branch: main
- 20 files with changes (modified/deleted)
- Notable changes:
  - Modified: codex-research.sh, codex-worker-launcher.sh
  - Modified: PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md, SHORTCODES.md
  - Deleted: Several old state files and UI component aliases
- Untracked: `.claude/`, `.mahirolab/examples/`, `.mahirolab/templates/`, `STATE_MANAGEMENT.md`

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
- [ ] Setup PostgreSQL database (local development)
- [ ] Run Prisma migrations and seed data
- [ ] Connect React frontend to backend API
- [ ] Add WebSocket/SSE for real-time updates
- [ ] Configure scraper to run every 1 hour
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel (frontend + backend)
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] ~Implement JWT authentication system~ (Phase 2 - postponed)

## Blockers/Issues
- PostgreSQL database not yet set up locally
- Environment variables (.env) not configured
- Real-time updates infrastructure not added
