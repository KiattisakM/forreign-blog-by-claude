## What Could Be Improved

### 📈 Content Parsing Could Be Enhanced
- **Issue:** Simple string-based markdown parser
- **Impact:** Low (works well for current content)

- **Action:** Current solution is acceptable, can enhance later

### 📈 No Loading States
- **Issue:** No loading spinners or skeletons
- **Impact:** Low (fast load times with mock data)
- **Recommendation:** Add in Phase 5 if time permits
- **Action:** Acceptable for MVP

### 📈 Pagination Not Interactive Yet
- **Issue:** Page info displays but no prev/next buttons
- **Impact:** Low (only 10 articles, fit on 2 pages)
- **Recommendation:** Could add in Task 3.3-3.4
- **Action:** Note for later enhancement

### 📈 Tags Not Clickable Yet
- **Issue:** Tags display but don't filter
- **Impact:** None (expected - filters come in Task 3.3)
- **Recommendation:** Will implement in Task 3.3
- **Action:** As planned
